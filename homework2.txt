Homework2: In groups

-1.  Install putty (OR Arduino IDE) on your laptop.

0. Split the program from last week into
   two half:  one called lcdlib.asm contains the
   LCD printig subroutines, the other: main.asm
   contains the main program.

1. Write a subroutine that prints a number (1 byte) in hex to the LCD.
   The input is in the A register.

2. Same as 1. but print it in binary.

3. (more difficult) same as 1. but in decimal.

4. Write a subroutine that just waits for some time.
   It should wait approximately   input* 1000 clock cycles.
   The input is in the A regiszter.  (Remember, in high speed
   mode the clock ticks at about 30kHz.)

5. Write a program that may use the above subroutines and
   prints a number that increases by 3 in every second.
